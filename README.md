# Survival_Analysis_Varying_Mixing_Weights
Survival Analysis with Varying Mixing Weights as part of a CIFRE thesis in Applied Mathematics 

The codes presented in this GitHub directory can be used to redo the simulations carried out during our research. The simulations are arranged in chapters, corresponding to the chapters of the PhD thesis in which they are presented. 

Here is a list of the different simulations :
- Chapter 2 :
  In this chapter, we compare two different Kaplan-Meier estimators for mixture models. We measure the information loss when modeling sick leaves with variable weight mixture models in censored duration models, comparing Ryzhov's and Maiboroda's methods, both using simulations and empirical data. Wr also apply variable weight mixture models for quantiles estimation.

  We adapt homogeneity tests for variable weight mixture models.
